# Database Website 
The coursework builds upon the movies and actors database I created created in the labs for another coursework.
I had to build a web front-end to the database using HTML, CSS and Javascript that will connect to my database and execute queries using PHP and SQL.
The functionality should include:

  * Adding a movie to the database
  * Adding an actor to the database
  * Searching for a movie in the database
  * Searching for an actor in the database
  * Deleting an actor from the database
  * Deleting a movie from the database
